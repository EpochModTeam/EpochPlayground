# Epoch Playground

Experimental Arma 3 Sandbox for Special Events and alternative gamemodes.

##### Special Events: 
###### Tower of Terror - https://github.com/chrisnic/TowerOfTerror
* Death run themed game mode for [Epoch Mod A3](https://github.com/EpochModTeam/Epoch). It features a variety of traps, obstacles and triggerable events that challenge players to be the first to reach the finish line. It was designed as a fun and alternative custom event for the Epoch Mod 0.5 celebration and currently uses the green mountain radio tower on Chernarus as a point of interest with which the level is built upon.
